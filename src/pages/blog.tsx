Truly the cowboy experience! Once I got back from the U.S. I slept one night in Zurich and then went on to Italy with my friends from ETH. We drove to Florence, Nerano, back to Florence and then spent our last night in a cabin in the woods. I finally got to see the Florence cathedral, which had been on my bucket list since 2017 AP Euro. I also finally saw my brother Michelangelo's \"David\"! Michelangelo was called \"The Divine\", so I wonder who made him the dumbest ninja turtle. Anyways, June was crazy.",
